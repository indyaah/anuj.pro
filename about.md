# About
 
I enjoy [coding][] and [sharing][sharing] about what I learn along the way, originally from India, currently living in [Hamburg][Hamburg].

I've been <strong>b & w screen </strong>lover since I started out in Computer Science and truly believe in OpenSource ideology.
I have worked with mainly Java/J2EE  and related technologies/frameworks and explored number of them, but there are no great badges around my belt.
Trying to learn a lot of things, any given time you'll find me wandering & wondering in my quest for knowledge.

I also have great interest in systems & performance engineering. Love to work with *NIX systems and trying to tweak things.
